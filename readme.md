This library provides an interface for handle commands and streams.

What problem does it resolve?
===
Sometimes, using Arduino, you feel that could be userfull to have a sort of shell executing some kind of command,
maybe handling input/output/error as stream lines like Serial (or some other serial stuff imported with a library like sd card reader of i2c).

This is the problem this library solves.
